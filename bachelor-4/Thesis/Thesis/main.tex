% Abstract
\abstract{Galaxies are typically classified based on the dominant form of radiation they emit into one of three main groups: active galactic nuclei (AGN), regions of active star formation, and low-ionization (nuclear) emission regions (LI(N)ERs). Our understanding of the processes that cause LI(N)ER-like emissions is the most lacking. The radiation source of this ionized gas and by extension the population of stars of these regions is poorly constrained. However, recent optical observations of the Tilted Disk in the Milky Way’s center from the Wisconsin H-Alpha Mapper (WHAM) telescope reveal emission line ratios in the central region of the Milky Way similar to that of other LI(N)ER galaxies, giving the opportunity for a much more detailed study of LI(N)ERs. Here we will identify the conditions that create emission line ratios similar to those observed, focusing at first on individual stellar sources, such as hot white dwarfs, or sub-dwarf OB (sdOB) stars . Our initial parameter study will provide a fundamental framework to expand into more complex stellar populations and develop a full understanding of the ionizing radiation responsible for LI(N)ERs. This structural understanding is essential in our search to decipher the formation and evolution of all galaxies, and could shed light even on the relationships between AGN, galaxies with active star formation, and LI(N)ERs.}

\subsection{Tables}

Size a table to fit in a single column (Table \ref{tab:1}) or across two columns (Table \ref{tab:2}). Avoid large tables (i.e., those that fit more than a single page), unless necessary.

Every table and figure should be cited in the text in numerical order (i.e., Table 2 cannot be cited before Table 1). Place table footnotes below the table, indicating them with superscripted lowercase letters or asterisks (for significance values and other statistical data).

\subsubsection{Table captions}
Every table should have a concise but clear caption to explain its main components independently from the text. If the table contains previously published material, cite the original source at the end of the caption. If the results are expressed as a percentage, state the absolute value(s) that correspond to 100\%.

\begin{table}[b]
  	\centering\footnotesize\sffamily
  	\caption{Example single-column table.}
  	\begin{tableminipage}{\linewidth}
    	\begin{tabularx} {\linewidth}{XXX}
			\toprule
            Column 1\textsuperscript{a} & Column 2 & Column 3  \\            
	    	\midrule
             1 &  1 &  1 \\
             2 &  2 &  2 \\
             3 &  3 &  3 \\
             4 &  4 &  4 \\
             5 &  5 &  5 \\

  	\begin{tableminipage}{\linewidth}
    	\begin{tabularx} {\linewidth}{XXXXXX}

            \bottomrule
    	\end{tabularx}
        \label{tab:2}
  	\end{tableminipage}
\end{table*}

\subsection{Figures}

Ensure that the figure will fit into either one column (Figure \ref{fig:1}) or two columns (Figure \ref{fig:1}). Images should be of sufficiently high resolution to be easily viewable when printed or on high-resolution screens (minimum of 300 dpi).

Every figure should be cited in the text in numerical order (i.e. Figure 2 cannot be cited before Figure 1). Figures should be referred to as "Figure" not "Fig." Denote figure parts with lowercase letters (e.g. Figure 1a, Figure 1b).

\subsubsection{Figure formatting}

Photographs must have internal scale markers and symbols; arrows or letters should contrast greatly with the background. Fira Sans is the recommended typeface for text within figures (if you don’t have it installed on your computer, you can download it from Google Fonts). Otherwise, a sans-serif such as Open Sans or Helvetica may be used. Where photographs of gel, autoradiograms, and so on have been processed to enhance their quality, this should be stated.

\subsubsection{Figure captions}

Every figure should have a concise but clear caption to explain its main components independently from the text. If the figure contains previously published material, cite the source at the end of the caption.
