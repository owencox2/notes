	abstract = {Decades of UV absorption line studies of the Circumgalactic Medium (CGM) of the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds have revealed crucial information on the physical conditions and distribution of gas surrounding galaxies. However, a precise analysis of these UV absorption line properties requires an accurate understanding of the emerging radiation field from the inner Milky Way, which photoionizes the gas. Currently, the radiation field shape widely used in the literature for these studies is built upon the stellar population surrounding the solar neighborhood. However, recent observations of optical emission lines from the inner Milky Way, towards the same direction as previous HST UV absorption line observations, have revealed clear evidence for significant differences between the local and inner Galaxy radiation fields. In particular, optical emission line ratio observations show that the inner Milky Way is largely ionized and similar to a class of extragalactic systems known as Low Ionization (Nuclear) Emission Regions--LI(N)ERs. We propose to use the inner Milky Way as a bridge to tie extragalactic and Galactic efforts in full Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) models and provide a realistic SED of the inner Milky Way. Our work will provide a more complete understanding of the source of ionization of LI(N)ERs seen in many galaxies, where only optical emission has been previously used as a constraint. In addition, our new SED will provide an accurate representation of the radiation field escaping from Galactic Center and photoionzing gas in the CGM of the Milky Way and Magellanic Couds and is crucial to fully understand the co-evolution of Local Group galaxies.},

          , 
            Optical emission lines are used to categorize galaxies into three groups according to their dominant central radiation source: active galactic nuclei, star formation, or low-ionization (nuclear) emission regions [LI(N)ERs] that may trace ionizing radiation from older stellar populations. Using the Wisconsin H-Alpha Mapper, we detect optical line emission in low-extinction windows within eight degrees of Galactic Center. The emission is associated with the 1.5-kiloparsec-radius “Tilted Disk” of neutral gas. We modify a model of this disk and find that the hydrogen gas observed is at least 48\% ionized. The ratio [NII] λ6584 angstroms/Hα λ6563 angstroms increases from 0.3 to 2.5 with Galactocentric radius; [OIII] λ5007 angstroms and Hβ λ4861 angstroms are also sometimes detected. The line ratios for most Tilted Disk sightlines are characteristic of LI(N)ER galaxies.},

	abstract = {Photoionized clouds are ubiquitous. They define the endpoints of stellar evolution (H II regions and planetary nebulae), constitute the interstellar and intergalactic media, and are found in high redshift quasars and star-forming galaxies. The spectra of these objects are dominated by emission lines that are sensitive to details of the emitting gas. These details include the microscopic atomic processes that cause the gas to glow; the density, composition, and temperature of the gas; and the radiation field of the central continuum source. Large-scale numerical codes that incorporate all the needed physics and predict the observed spectrum have become essential tools in understanding these objects. This article reviews the current status of the numerical simulations of emitting gas, with particular emphasis on photoionized clouds and the underlying simplicity that governs these nebulae; the types of questions that can be addressed by today's codes; and the big questions that remain unanswered.},
