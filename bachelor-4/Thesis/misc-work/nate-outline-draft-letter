Nate's paper addresses the issue of the limited propagation distance of lasers, proposing filamentation mediated by the Kerr Effect as a solution. The Kerr effect causes the laser to self focus due to the laser's electric field decreasing the dipole moment of the medium and the index of refraction. This allows filamentation to take place over vast distances. Could have implications in LIDAR, wireless energy transfer, weaponry, and sensing. I had trouble connecting some of the concepts laid out in the outline, such as ionization, energy dynamics, and supercontiuum generation to the increased propagation of the laser, but found the overall story compelling.
