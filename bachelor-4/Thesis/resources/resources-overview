*Ch. 4&5 - energy levels of atoms, ions, and molecules
      sounds complicated
      have not read
      seems foundational to other chapters, is probably worth a skim but not an in depth exploration

*Ch 6 - Spontaneous Emission, Stimulated Emission, and Absorption
      lot of detail. seems very useful

Ch 7 - Radiative Transfer
      radiation through a gas clouds
      bigger picture of ch 6

Ch 13 - Ionization Processes ( 13.1: Photoionization! key! )


Ch 18 - Nebular Diagnostics (BPT 18.8)
  what defines a LINER in the BPT Diagrams
  cites papers on possible LINER sources Veilleux and Osterbrock 1987 worth looking into for previous exploration of question.


very dense!

PROPOSAL
---

much details on significance,
  pg 2 1/2 of giant ellipticals and 1/3 of disk galaxies are LI(N)ERs
future application
  science goals: what is shape and intensity of rad field of inner Milky Way?
  what stellar populations dominate the ionization of LI(N)ERs (pg. 3)
  Could the galaxy have experiencd a Seryfert Flare ~3.5Myr ago? was it an AGN?
  Galactic Evolution (pg. 4)

14 - LI(N)ERs are still under debate
13 - Describes LI(N)ERs
15,16 - scope of LI(N)ERs
6 - Milky Way is a LI(N)ER
22 - proposed LI(N)ER ionization

Milky Way Ionization Modeling (Numerical simulation investigating the vertical extent of the Milky Way's warm ionized medium)
---

Details of simulation of this kind of thing? maybe talk to DK about how this will be useful
mechanism for supporting ionized gas in MW high above midplane not well understood
photoionization from midplane OB stars + supernovae
